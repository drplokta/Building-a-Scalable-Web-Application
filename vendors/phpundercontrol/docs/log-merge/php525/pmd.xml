  <violation rule="CRAP" priority="1" package="global">More than 5.00% of the project's methods have a Change Risk Analysis and Predictions (CRAP) index that is above the threshold of 30.
The CRAP index of a function or method uses cyclomatic complexity and code coverage from automated tests to help estimate the effort and risk associated with maintaining legacy code. A CRAP index over 30 is a good indicator of crappy code.</violation>
