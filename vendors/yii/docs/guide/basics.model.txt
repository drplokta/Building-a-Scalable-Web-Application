Model
=====

A model is an instance of [CModel] or its child class. Models are used to
keep data and their relevant business rules.

A model represents a single data object. It could be a row in a database
table or a form of user inputs. Each field of the data object is
represented as an attribute of the model. The attribute has a label and can
be validated against a set of rules.

Yii implements two kinds of models: form model and active record. They
both extend from the same base class [CModel].

A form model is an instance of [CFormModel]. Form model is used to keep
data collected from user inputs. Such data are often collected, used and
then discarded. For example, on a login page, we can use a form model to
represent the username and password information that are provided by an end
user. For more details, please refer to [Working with Form](/doc/guide/form.model)

Active Record (AR) is a design pattern used to abstract database access in
an object-oriented fashion. Each AR object is an instance of
[CActiveRecord] or its child class, representing a single row in a database
table. The fields in the row are represented as properties of the AR
object. Details about AR can be found in [Active Record](/doc/guide/database.ar).
