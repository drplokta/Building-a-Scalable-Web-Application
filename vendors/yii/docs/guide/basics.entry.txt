Entry Script
============

Entry script is the bootstrap PHP script that handles user requests
initially. It is the only PHP script that end users can directly request to
execute.

In most cases, entry script of a Yii application contains the code that
is as simple as follows,

~~~
[php]
// remove the following line when in production mode
defined('YII_DEBUG') or define('YII_DEBUG',true);
// include Yii bootstrap file
require_once('path/to/yii/framework/yii.php');
// create application instance and run
$configFile='path/to/config/file.php';
Yii::createWebApplication($configFile)->run();
~~~

The script first includes the Yii framework bootstrap file `yii.php`. It
then creates a Web application instance with the specified configuration
and runs it.

Debug Mode
----------

A Yii application can run in either debug or production mode according to
the constant value `YII_DEBUG`. By default, this constant value is defined
as `false`, meaning production mode. To run in debug mode, define this
constant as `true` before including the `yii.php` file. Running application
in debug mode is less efficient because it keeps many internal logs. On the
other hand, debug mode is also more helpful during development stage
because it provides richer debugging information when error occurs.
